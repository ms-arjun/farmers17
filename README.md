farners-17 is a tribute website for Tamil Nadu farmers who protest to save farming in 2017
    FARMERS-17 Is a Tribute Webpage for Tamil Nadu Farmers Protest was a protest against the 
    Bhartiya Janata Party-led central government by farmers from Tamil Nadu demanding waiver 
    of their farm loans among other demands due to crop failures. The protests started after
     the 2016-2017 Drought in Tamil Nadu, which was caused after a worst rainfall to the state 
     after 140 years. This led to many farmers committing suicides and dying of heart attacks.
