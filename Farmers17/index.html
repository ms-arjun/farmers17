    <p>A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for 
        food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some 
        combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other 
        livestock. A farmer might own the farm land or might work as a laborer on 
        land owned by others. In most developed economies, a "farmer" is usually a
         farm owner (landowner), while employees of the farm are known as farm workers
          (or farmhands). However, in other older definitions a farmer was a person who 
          promotes or improves the growth of plants, land or crops or raises animals 
          (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention.Agriculture is the prime and 
          traditional occupation for the people of Tamil Nadu. About 56% of the people of 
          Tamil Nadu are farmers. Agriculture sector supplies food and fodder to the people
           and cattle, respectively. It is the source of raw material for many of the industries.</p>

    <h3>Cropping seasons of Tamil Nadu</h3>
    <p>Farmers selected particular crops to be cultivated in a season, to suit soil and availability 
        of water in that season. Thus, most farmers in Tamil Nadu cultivate crops in three different seasons as given below: </p>
      <ol>
      <li> 1.Sornavari (Kharif season - Chitthirai pattern)</li>
      <li>  2. Samba (Summer season - Adipattam) </li>
      <li> 3. Navarai (Rabi season - Karthigai pattern). </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Among the food crops, paddy is the prime crop cultivated in all the districts of Tamil Nadu. 
        The Kaveri delta (especially the undivided Thanjavur district) is known as the granary of south India. 
        Pulses that are grown in Tamil Nadu include Bengal gram, red gram, green gram, black gram and horse gram.</p>
        <p>Tamil Nadu agriculture is the most overriding sector in the economy of the state. Around 70 percent of the 
            state's population is involved in agricultural activities as this is one of the major means of livelihood 
            in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu has occupied an area of 1.3 lakh sq. km with an overall area of around 63 L.Ha for
             plantation. The primary responsibility of the government of Tamil Nadu is to activate stability in the
              agricultural sector and also increase the sustainability in the agricultural production of the state.
               This is done with an objective to meet the demands put forth by the growing population in the food
                segment as well as the raw materials department in the agro-based industries. This will take a toll
                 on the unemployment in the rural areas. The agriculture in Tamil Nadu has executed a creditable 
                 performance over the years with the help of so many efficient farmers who are both responsive and
                  receptive to the technological development introduced in the agricultural sector of Tamil Nadu. 
                  The agricultural department of Tamil Nadu has decided upon implementing various development schemes 
                  and generating innovative technologies to ensure growth in the state's agriculture. Tamil Nadu Agriculture 
                  Dept. has taken up various programmes to step up the agricultural production as well as to improve the economic 
                  status of the cultivation sector.</p>
