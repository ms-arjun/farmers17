<h2>FARMERS-17</h2>
<p>FARMERS-17 Is a Tribute Webpage for Tamil Nadu Farmers Protest was a protest against the 
    Bhartiya Janata Party-led central government by farmers from Tamil Nadu demanding waiver 
    of their farm loans among other demands due to crop failures. The protests started after
     the 2016-2017 Drought in Tamil Nadu, which was caused after a worst rainfall to the state 
     after 140 years. This led to many farmers committing suicides and dying of heart attacks. </p>

        The protest was started by a group of farmers led by 72-year old farmer P. Ayyakannu on 
        March 14, 2017 at the Jantar Mantar in Delhi and went on for months. The protesting farmers 
        shaved half of their moustaches and heads, held snakes and mice in their mouths, performed mock 
        funerals, flogged themselves, brought the skulls of other farmers who had committed suicide, 
        drank their urine and even ate human feces as protest.</p>
        <p>Ponnusamy Ayyakannu is an activist, lawyer and farmer and the chief of the Desiya 
            Thenidhiya Nathigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam.   He led the 2017 Tamil Nadu Farmers 
            Protest against the central government at New Delhi, demanding the agricultural loan 
            in cooperative banks to be abandoned.Ayyakannu was born on 1949 in Musiri, Tiruchirappalli 
            district in Tamil Nadu in a family of nine children. He completed his primary education at 
            Musiri Primary School, his higher education at the National High School in Trichy, his 
            Pre-university course at Jamal Mohammad College, his degree at Bishop Heber College, and
             completed his law studies at the Madras Law College during the 1970s. He then began work
              in agriculture and his profession as a lawyer after receiving his family's inheritance. 
              His wife and two sons are also advocates. Ayyakkannu contested for the Janata Party in the
               Musiri constituency in the 1977 election. He got 15,000 votes despite not winning the election.
                In March 2019, he announced that 111 farmers would contest against Narendra Modi in his Varanasi
                 (Lok Sabha constituency) in protest against the failure of the BJP to deliver on its promises made 
                 to farmers during the 2014 election.On April 8, 2019, he announced that he is not going to contest 
                 after a meeting with Amit Shah and Piyush Goyal the previous day. Initially, Ayyakannu was part of 
                 the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and acted as its deputy general
                  secretary of Tamil Nadu. He resumed his demonstrations against the central government when the Bharatiya 
                  Janata party (BJP) came to power in 2014. He later left the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and formed his own farmers 
                  organization called the Desiya Thenidhiya Nathigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam (National South Indian River
                   Interlinking Agriculturalists Association). </p>

        <h3>CAUSE</h3>
      <p>Tamil Nadu in 2016 suffered severe drought than in 100 years. Many farmers were unable to pay the loans back. 
        Ayyakannu led Protestants in New Delhi and asked the government to abandon the loan they got from the cooperative banks.
         These protesters also demanded the establishment and proper functioning of Cauvery River water management, as the Karnataka
          Government wasn't releasing water for Tamil Nadu, as per the Supreme court order</p></div>
   
    <div>  <h3>DROUGHT</h3><p>The 2016-2017 Drought in Tamil Nadu created the worst agricultural crisis in the state, where more than 40
         percent of people earn a living from agriculture. The crisis was caused by water shortage due to poor rainfall, reduced crop costs,
          and decreasing access to formal financial services.The state government announced the entire state as drought hit. 
        In the year 2016, Tamil Nadu faced the worst rainfall for the prior 140 years which led to the decline state's cropping area
         by 41.5% and the paddy procurement by 84.4%.Average annual rainfall decreased by 62% in 2016. The Northeast monsoon season
          failed in the state with the worst rainfall ever, with scattered rain in some areas. This led to the highest deficit of 
          reservoir levels in all of India with an 82% reduction. This led to only one-third of the fields not sown in Tamil Nadu. 
        </p></div>
        <div><h3>FARMER SUICIDES</h3><P>Tamil Nadu recorded 604 suicides of farm workers in 2015. A local fact-finding team reported that in the districts of 
            Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur, Ariyalur, Tanjavur and Pudukkottai more than 120 farmers had committed suicide or died by suicide
             in two months in 2017. The reports stated that the numbers began with one or two deaths a day and grew to ten. Since October 
             2016, over 270 farmers in the state have reportedly committed suicide or died naturally. A local farmers association insisted 
             that there were more than 250 farmer suicides since October 2016. The farmers who protested claimed that more than 106 farmers
              had committed suicide in a month and they used skulls and bones to highlight the suicides of the farmers</P></div>
