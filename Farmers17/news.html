    <p>The 2017 Tamil Nadu Farmers Protest was a protest against the Bhartiya Janata Party-led central government by farmers from Tamil Nadu demanding waiver of their farm loans among other demands due to crop failures. The protests started after the 2016â€“2017 Drought in Tamil Nadu, which was caused after a worst rainfall to the state after 140 years. This led to many farmers committing suicides and dying of heart attacks.</p>

    Tamil Nadu farmer's cry and Modi's answer - Times of India</a>
    <p>Delhi has seen yet another massive protest on the streets of Delhi on 30th November 2018. It is 4th such protest in this year. The mother of all these battle started with Tamil Nadu Farmers protesting with unconventional and distinctive methodologies at Delhi. It all started with the worst ever famine in the last 100 years in Tamil Nadu that saw an 82% deficit on the average rainfall of Tamil Nadu. Subsequently, farmers had a disastrous season. The Tamil Nadu government requested for INR 40,000 crores towards the relief fund. But the Central Government approved a financial assistance of INR 2014 crores. The offering by the government as compensation was too less and it triggered a widespread discontent and anger among the Tamil Nadu agrarian society.</p>
